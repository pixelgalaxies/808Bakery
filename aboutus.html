				<h3>Our Journey...</h3>
				<p>In 1986, 808 Bakery opened its first location on a quiet street 

	corner in the heart of Honolulu. From the beginning 808 Bakery has 

	been cherished for its classic American baked goods, and warm, inviting 

	atmosphere. We strive to make the best pastries on the island, keeping 

	our regular customers as well as bringing in new ones. We are guided by 

	the notion that charity begins at home and then extends to the global 

	community, from daily donations to relief efforts we are committed to 

	supporting the community. In the past we have partnered with breast 

	cancer organizations and school bake sales.
